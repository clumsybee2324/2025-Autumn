# 2025-Autumn
Various Mini Projects made in Autumn 2025
My ex repositories are too messy as me; thus, i have decided to create a new repository to tidy the Autumn 2025 Projects.
This repository will be included "My C Programming Language Projects" as pointers, dynamic memory, preprocessor.
Moreover, will be included "My C++ Programming Language Projects" as inheritance, polymorphism, vectors.
Also, "Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript".
I hope you will enjoy in this journey(also me)!
Have a nice day.
Bye!
